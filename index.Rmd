# Introductory
Hi, I am Chuyuan Xu.\
I am a current 2nd-year MPH candidate at the Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University. I am in the department of Biostatistics, pursuing a certificate in Advanced Epidemiology. I developed this website to support my learning in P8105: Data Science I in the Fall of 2025. At the same time, I am excited to use this website as a platform to share my experience and showcase my work with you.

To learn more about my experience, you can click [here](resume.html) to view my resume.
